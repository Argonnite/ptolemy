<h1>High Quality Sound Synthesis</h1>
<p>
This demonstration produces the same sounds as in the
<a href="synth.html">sound synthesis</a> demo, but uses
a real-time processor, a programmable digital signal processor (DSP),
in order to get higher quality sound.
The sample rate used is 32,000 samples per second, four times
higher than the 8,000 samples per second supported by the workstation.
The processor is a Motorola DSP56002.
The synthesis technique, due to John Chowning,
is <a href="fm.html">frequency modulation</a>.
