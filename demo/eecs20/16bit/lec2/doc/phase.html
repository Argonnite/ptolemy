<h1>Phase and Frequency of Sinusoids</h1>
<p>
This demonstration shows three sinusoids of different frequencies.
The black and blue sinusoids have a 90 degree (PI/2 radian) phase
difference between them.

The phase of the red sinusoid is controlled by a slider in the control
panel:

<p>
The frequency of all the sinusoids are also controlled by
a slider.  By default, the frequency is set to 440 Hz, which is the
frequency of the musical note A above middle C.
<h1>Observations</h1>
Changes in frequency are distinctly heard.
Changes in phase are not.
