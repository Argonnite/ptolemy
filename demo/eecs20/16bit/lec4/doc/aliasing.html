<h1>Anti-Aliasing</h1>
<p>
In this demonstration, we replay an <a href="../lec3/aliasing.html">
aliasing demonstration</a> where a sinusoid is sampled at 8 kHz.
As the frequency of the sinusoid exceeds 4 kHz, the resulting
sound falls in pitch rather than rising.  This is the effect of
aliasing.  We modify this demonstration to use a low-pass filter
that attenuates frequencies above 4 kHz.  This noticeably reduces
the effects of aliasing.
