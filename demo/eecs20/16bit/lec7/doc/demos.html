<h2>Quantization of a sinusoid</h2>
<p>
In this demonstration, we run a program that generates a sine wave
and quantizes it to some number of bits.  The control panel for the program
is as follows:
<p>

<p>
The sine wave quantized to two bits (four levels) looks like this:
<p>

<p>
The sound is noisy at fewer than 5 bits, but fairly accurate at 5 bits.
Notice that the frequency is identifiable even for the most coarsly quantized
signal (1 bit).
<h2>Quantization of speech</h2>
<p>
In this demonstration, we listen to a speech signal quantized by varying
omounts.   Even with only one bit per sample, the speech signal is
understandable, although it is very noisy.
At six bits per sample (64 levels), the quality is quite good.
In general, quantizing speech signals well is harder than quantizing
sinusoids because they have more <em>dynamic range</em>.
In other words, the signal level varies quite a bit.  With fixed
quantization, the quieter parts of the signal will be more coarsely
quantized than the louder parts.
