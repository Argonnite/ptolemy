<h1>Speech</h1>
<p>
In this demonstration, a segment of speech is processed by the linear
shift invariant system studied in the <a href="lpf.html">previous
demonstration</a>.  It is "filtered" by a low-pass filter which
attenuates frequencies above about 800 Hz.
You hear that the speech sounds more muffled.  The "crispness"
in the sound is gone.
<p>
We also demonstrate the results of filtering speech with a high-pass
filter that attenuates frequencies below about 800 Hz.
This results in speech that is distinctly "crisp", but lacks body.
